## Things I want to know more about

### Big O Notation

    Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

#### Why it's  matters

    A grasp of Big O is an important tool when dealing with algorithms that need to operate at scale, allowing you to make the correct choices and acknowledge trade-offs when working with different data sets.

### [Python 3 Module of the WeekÂ¶](https://pymotw.com/3/index.html)

    PyMOTW-3 is a series of articles written by Doug Hellmann to demonstrate how to use the modules of the Python 3 standard library. It is based on the original PyMOTW series, which covered Python 2.7. See About Python Module of the Week for details including the version of Python and tools used.

#### Why it's  matters

    it's almost introduce all the concepts of Python,Programming and tools in it.

### Questions?

 > Still not that Clear "Big O Notation?
 >
 > Cryptographic how much it's safe to use as a Fresh graduate programmer?
