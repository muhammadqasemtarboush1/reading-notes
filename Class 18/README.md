## cryptography

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code
or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type
of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed
number of positions down the alphabet

* For example:
    * with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius
      Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence

* Breaking the cipher:
  The Caesar cipher can be easily broken even in a ciphertext-only scenario. Two situations can be considered:
    * an attacker knows (or guesses) that some sort of simple substitution cipher has been used, but not specifically
      that it is a Caesar scheme;
    * an attacker knows that a Caesar cipher is in use, but does not know the shift value.
