## What is Django

With Django, you can take web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours.
Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing
your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

## Features

* Ridiculously fast.
  * Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.
* Fully loaded.
  * Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common web development tasks. Django takes care of user
      authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks — right out of the box.
* Reassuringly secure.
  * Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection,
      cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking. Its user authentication system provides a
      secure way to manage user accounts and passwords.
* Exceedingly scalable.
  * Some of the busiest sites on the planet use Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale to meet the heaviest
      traffic demands.
* Incredibly versatile.
  * Companies, organizations and governments have used Django to build all sorts of things — from content management
      systems to social networks to scientific computing platforms.

## Intro to Django

1. Object-relational mapper
    1. Deﬁne your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free — but you can
       still write SQL if needed.

2. URLs and views
    1. A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality web application. Django encourages beautiful
       URL design and doesn’t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp.
    2. To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your
       app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.

3. Templates
    1. Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed
       to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end
       developers.
       But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.

4. Forms
    1. Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML,
       validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types. Django also
       provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and
       update data.

5. Authentication
    1. Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts,
       groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow
       users to create accounts and safely log in/out.
    2. For code snippets click [Here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/auth/)
6. Admin
    1. One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata
       in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can
       immediately use to start managing content on your site. It’s easy to set up and provides many
       hooks for customization.
    2. For code snippets click [Here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/contrib/admin/)
7. Internationalization
    1. Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of
       dates, times, numbers, and time zones. It lets developers and template authors specify which parts of their apps
       should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures, and it uses these hooks to localize web
       applications for particular users according to their preferences.

8. Security
    1. Django provides multiple protections against:
        1. Clickjacking
        2. Cross-site scripting
        3. Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
        4. SQL injection
        5. Remote code execution
