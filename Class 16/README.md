## What is Serverless?

Serverless is a cloud application development and execution model that lets developers build and run code
without managing servers, and without paying for idle cloud infrastructure.

### Serverless vs. PaaS, containers, and VMs

> Because serverless, platform as a service (PaaS), containers, and virtual machines (VMs) all play a
critical role in the cloud application development and compute ecosystem, it’s useful to compare how
serverless compares to the others across some key attributes.

* Provisioning time
* Administrative burden
* Maintenance
* Scaling
* Capacity planning
* Statelessness
* High availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR)
* Resource utilization
* Billing granularity and savings

### Serverless, Kubernetes and Knative

> Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment,
management and scaling of containers. Kubernetes' automation dramatically simplifies the development
of container-based applications.

### Pros and cons of serverless

* Pros
  * Improved developer productivity
  * Pay for execution only
  * Develop in any language
  * Streamlined development/DevOps cycles.
  * Cost-effective performance
  * Usage visibility.
* Cons
* Unacceptable latency for certain applications:
* Higher costs for stable or predictable workloads
* Monitoring and debugging issues
* Vendor lock-in

### Use cases for serverless

* Serverless and microservices

* API backends
* Data processing
* Massively parallel compute/“Map” operations
* Stream processing workloads

## Notes

* Serverless does not mean 'no servers'
* Serverless is more than just FaaS (Function-as-a-service, or FaaS, is a cloud computing service that
enables developers to run code or containers in response to specific events or requests, without
specifying or managing the infrastructure required to run to code.)

I reviewed the following topics:

* [Python API](https://realpython.com/python-api/)
* [Http server](https://pymotw.com/3/http.server/index.html)
* [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

## Things I want to know more about

* the most interesting topic for me is python API I think I will use it in mid project
I would love if we see and get some examples as along with http server
