### Main points

In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

Sometimes this results in clearer code, but this style can also be abused. Like in JavaScript, it is up to you to decide whether it is worth extracting a variable for readability. Keep in mind that if the map() body is too nested, it might be a good time to extract a component.

HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

## Note

You can pass an array into the value attribute, allowing you to select multiple options in a select tag
