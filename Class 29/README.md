The Advice: Communicate!
The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate,
communicate! This may seem like an anti-climactic piece of advice, but I hope to be able to demonstrate to you that it’s
actually the most important skill to prepare prior to an interview.

#### some tips:
* Restate the Question
* Ask About Edge Cases
* Ask About Test Cases
* Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
* Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
* Stuck? Ask for Help!
* Bonus: Communicating Prior to the Interview
* We’re All Human

## Notes

as I discuss examples in the rest of this article, they will have a
software engineering slant as it is the most familiar domain to me. 
Despite that slant, you can apply these skills to any whiteboard-style
interview.
